- id: "debugging-and-troubleshooting"
  title: "Debugging and Troubleshooting"
  questions:
    - "What's the root cause of this error? $STACKTRACE"
    - "What changes recently introduced $BUG or $ERROR?"
    - "A user reported a bug. Please diagnose it."
    - "Under what conditions can $BUG occur?"
  prompt: |
    1. Analyze the Error Context:
       - If `$STACKTRACE` or `$ERROR` is provided, use `file_search_tool` to locate the associated line numbers, modules, or functions in the codebase. Focus on identifying the source of the issue.
       - Take note of any assumptions that can safely be made based on the query or programming language (e.g. immutability, type safety).
    2. Investigate Specific Identifiers:
       - If a specific function, method, or constant is mentioned:
         - Use `file_info_tool` to retrieve its definition and inspect its surrounding context (e.g., imports, dependencies, or usage patterns).
         - Use `file_search_tool` to locate references to the identifier throughout the project.
    3. Trace Code Relationships:
       - Use `file_spelunker_tool` to analyze upstream callers or downstream callees of `$FUNCTION`. Leverage the prebuilt call map to trace function interactions, dependencies, and affected pathways.
    4. Analyze Code History:
       - Use `git_pickaxe_tool` to search the commit history for changes introducing `$BUG` or `$ERROR`. Prioritize:
         - Lines or functions relevant to the stack trace or function mentioned.
         - Commit messages and diffs for context.
       - Supplement with other git tools (e.g., `git_log_tool`, `git_show_tool`) for broader or specific commit details.
       - **Important**: Only use Git tools if they are included in the available tools list.
    5. Correlate Findings Across Tools:
       - Cross-reference results from `file_search_tool`, `file_info_tool`, and `file_spelunker_tool` to establish a clear picture of:
         - Which modules or functions are likely involved.
         - How changes in the codebase might correlate with the observed bug.
    6. Detailed Root Cause Analysis:
       - Never respond with instructions for the user to troubleshoot on their own unless you can't find anything useful.
         - Explain that you were unable to find any possible causes
         - Suggest locations to add printf debugging to help identify the issue
         - Write unit test cases to reproduce the error for the user
       - Provide a detailed explanation of the root cause, including:
         - Specific references to files, functions, or commits.
         - Hypotheses based on tool outputs (e.g., a faulty function call, a breaking change).
       - If no root cause could be identified:
         - Clearly note in bold that you were unable to find the root cause.
         - Recommend further steps for debugging or troubleshooting
           - Write a test case to reproduce the error
           - Cite locations in the code to insert printf-debugging or logging

- id: documenting-code
  title: Documenting Code
  questions:
    - "How do I document $MODULE or $FILE?"
    - "What should a README include for $FEATURE or $COMPONENT?"
    - "What related files or namespaces should I include in the documentation for $ENTITY?"
  prompt: |
    1. Set Context:
       - Use `file_list_tool` to identify all files in the same directory or namespace as `$MODULE`, `$FEATURE`, or `$FILE`
       - Use `file_search_tool` to query the namespace for comprehensive background information, which can help determine next steps
       - Refine those findings further with the `file_info_tool`.
       - Search for existing documentation using `file_search_tool` to understand what is already covered
    2. Plan Structure:
       - Start the documentation with a high-level overview:
         - What is the purpose of the `$FEATURE` or `$MODULE`?
         - How does it fit into the larger project?
       - Break the explanation into layers:
         1. Overall Concept: A concise introduction to the feature or module
         2. Key Features or Components: A list of main functionalities, components, behaviors, or use cases
         3. Details of Subcomponents: Drill down into specific files, modules, or functions
         4. Identify relationships between components and how they interact
       - Ensure logical flow: from the general purpose to specific implementation details
       - Ensure structured content: use bullet points, code snippets, and examples for clarity
       - Use visuals: use diagrams, flow charts, tables, example code snippets, and tree diagrams to illustrate complex relationships
    3. Gather Supporting Information:
       - Use `file_contents_tool` to fetch examples or critical sections of code for inclusion in the documentation
       - Include patterns, libraries, or dependencies using `file_search_tool`
       - Cross-reference with related sections of the project using `file_spelunker_tool` to identify dependencies or relationships
    4. Formatting the Document:
       - Use the following outline:
         - Introduction: Summarize the purpose and role of the feature/module
         - Usage Examples: Provide simple and advanced examples to demonstrate functionality
         - API or Key Functions: Document each significant function or API with:
           - Parameters
           - Expected behavior
           - Example usage
         - Related Modules or Features: Reference related parts of the codebase for context
         - Troubleshooting/FAQs: Address common pitfalls or questions
         - Version/History (Optional): Note when and why major changes were introduced (if git tools are available)
    5. Create or Update README.md:
       - Check for an existing `README.md` in the same directory or namespace. If absent:
         - Create one following the structure above
         - Integrate the new information with any existing project-level README, linking to the specific module's section
    6. Review and Summarize:
       - Generate a concise summary for the user with a list of files and components documented
       - Provide recommendations for further documentation efforts, such as creating tutorials or in-depth guides

    #### Key Points to Emphasize:
    - Documentation should always aim for clarity and completeness but avoid unnecessary verbosity.
    - Top-down explanations are most effective: general concepts first, then specific details.
    - Explain entities in terms of Components, Behaviors, Relationships, and Dependencies.
    - Ensure the documentation is detailed and includes examples to aid understanding.
